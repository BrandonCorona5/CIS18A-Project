Nail salon appointment

Team Members: Brandon Corona, Jessica Luevano

Once the program is ran, it prints a welcome message with a list of options being followed from it. 
Those options contain 6 of them with 2 add ons, if the customer desires. Once the customer selects an option, 
they are asked if they would like to add an add on. The program won't continue to the next step if the customer 
inputs a invalid option. Once the customer selects a valid option, it saves their data like name and appointment
date/time. Once all the demands are met, a copy will be given out of their appointment details with the price at 
the end.
